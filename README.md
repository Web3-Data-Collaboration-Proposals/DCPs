# Introduction

The "EIP"-like Web3 data collaboration infrastructure - DCP (Data Collaboration Proposals) co-sponsored by KNN3 Network and POD, describes the standards for Web3 data collaboration, including data schema specifications, data sources/data structures for tracking and collecting data, and the data schema used to decode the structured result. The DCP is tracked & managed under the https://github.com/Web3-Data-Collaboration-Proposals/DCPs repository.

The primary purpose of creating the DCP is for the broad Web3 community to understand and collaborate on the integration of Web3 data schema. DCP is an efficient way to allow data providers/users to promote their data solutions through an explicit data schema specification, which allows data aggregators/mix dapps to easily integrate the data they produce. DCP labels mean that DCP creators are allowed to choose existing labels to indicate the functionality of the DCP, creators can also create their own labels.
