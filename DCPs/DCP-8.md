DCP-8 is integrating Lens Protocol into KNN3 Network graph database. The Lens Protocol is a Web3 social graph on the Polygon. It is designed to empower creators to own the links between themselves and their community, forming a fully composable, user-owned social graph. 

## Motivation & rationales

With DCP-8, users are able to explore, follow/unfollow others' profiles based on Lens Protocol in KNN3 Network GraphX.
Compared to Web2 social media networks, Lens Protocol is a user-owned, open social graph that any application can plug into. As the true owners of their content, creators no longer need to worry about losing their content, audience, and livelihood based on the whims of an individual platform's algorithms and policies. Additionally, each application using Lens Protocol benefits the whole ecosystem, turning the zero-sum game into a collaborative one. Developers can design meaningful social experiences without needing to turn to feedback mechanisms to lock in a user's attention.

## Specification

Explore usersâ€™/EOA Lens Profiles in graph style.
Follow/unfollow someone that owns Lens profiles.
