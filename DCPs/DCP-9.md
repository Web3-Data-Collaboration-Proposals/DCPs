DCP-9 is intended to be that the KNN3 GraphX supports Polygon. Polygon is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. Polygon’s scaling solutions have seen widespread adoption with 37,000+ applications hosted, 1B+ total transactions processed, 140M+ unique user addresses, and $5B+ in assets secured.

## Motivation & rationales

In the current Web3 world, data silos have become the most significant issue confronting the savvy developing d/Apps whilst the native barrier of Smart Contract creates segregation of the data interoperability on different chains. As the backbone of web3 applications, smart contracts today are facing a series of challenges in data availability. Correspondingly, by integrations Polygon, KNN3 GraphX can provide on-chain accessibility of multi-chain data, adopts a trustless path to enable the possibility of conversion from off-chain data to on-chain credits, thereby reconstructing the intrinsic value of data. 


## Specification

Running Polygon full node and obtain addresses’ assets, footprints, and social connections(Lens Protocol).
