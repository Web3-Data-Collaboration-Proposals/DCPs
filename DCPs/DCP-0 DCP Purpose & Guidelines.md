## DCP
Data Collaboration Proposals (DCP) describe standards for Web3 data collaboration, including data schema specifications, data source/data structure for tracking & collecting, and data schema for decoding structured outcomes. The DCP is tracked & managed under the https://github.com/Web3-Data-Collaboration-Proposals/DCPs repository.

More information: dcp3.org (to be set up)

## DCP rationale
The main purpose to create a DCP is to allow wide web3 communities to understand and integrate a certain type of web3 data schema collaboratively. In current web3, tons of data are produced on the ledgers over different kinds of blockchains, yet only a small portion of data has been widely acknowledged and re-used in other protocols/applications. It is not only a waste of web3 data, but also limits combinability. 

### Stop reinventing the wheel
For Web3 data providers and data consumers, DCPs help web3 communities to discover data solutions that aim at specific problems, so the web3 developers do not have to re-build duplicated data apps to solve the same problem. 

### Data acknowledgment & composability
Additionally, DCP is an effective way to allow data providers/users to promote their data solution with a clear specification of the data schema, it allows data aggregators/mix-dapps to conveniently integrate their produced data.


## DCP tags
DCP author allows selecting existing tags to indicate DCP’s features, also, authors can create their tags.

### Tags example
#Utility-NFT
- #Loyalty system
- #Credits / Scores
- #Reputation records

#Proof
- #Proof-of-Action Credentials
- #Proof-of-Status Credentials
- #Proof-of-Relationship Credentials


## DCP workflow

Parties involved in the process and responsibilities
**DCP authors**
 A web3er who wants to collaborate on a type of data schema standards to drive acknowledgment and composability.
**DCP revisors**
A group of data professionals & Web3 engineers who assist DCP authors to write DCP proposals into collaborative-friendly public readable documents.

### DCP process 
The following is the standardization process for all DCPs in all tracks:

**Idea** - An idea that is pre-draft. This is the best status to pre-check the data structure and validate the effectiveness of proposed solutions.

**Draft** - The first formally submitted proposal will be listed in the DCP pipeline, the author can still work on it before sending it to review. The DCP will be assigned its official DCP number.

***Revise** - The DCP is under revision.

**Review** - Revisors group will step in and assist to reshape the format before going live. The DCP will be temporarily held in the “Pre-release” status.

**Live** - After revision is completed, the DCP will be merged into the “Published” status, it is life!

**Withdrawn** - The DCP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed DCP. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this DCP number. If the idea is pursued at later date it will be considered as a new proposal.

**Upgrading** - To keep the solution and data schema up-to-date, some DCPs may need to be upgraded accordingly, DCP will be switched to upgrading mode, and a new Pull Request will be held in “Pre-release” until upgrading is completed.
